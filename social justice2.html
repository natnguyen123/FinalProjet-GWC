<h1>Backround Info</h1>
<p>Immigration has been a big part in the United States.<br>After World War I, there was a big distrust in immigrants,
later causing<br>discrimination across the United States. Schools were affected by this too.<br>Clearly not a big fan of immigrants!
Also, after World War I,<br>when the Great Migration was going on, and more and more<br>African Americans were moving up North,
many did not like this,<br>causing many feuds and riots, especially in Chicago,<br>where riots left 38 people dead and over
50 wounded and/or injured.<br>Again, this affected schools, causing discrimination and segregation.<br>Busing was also created somewhere
in the 1950's. This was the practice<br>of assigning African Americans to schools in the<br>suburbs in an effort to stop racial
segregation.<br>Unfortunately, this didn't work.

<h2>Discrimination In Schools</h2>
According to a study, teachers were shown videos of preschool students.<br>There was a white boy and girl and a black boy and girl.<br>
The teachers were instructed to find any bad behavior in the students.<br>There was no bad behavior in any of the students, but in<br>
the results of the study, it was shown that most teachers claimed to<br>have seen more bad behavior in the black children rather than<br>
the white children. Students also discriminate against their black classmates.<br>According to race, religion, and skin color, bonding in
general<br>becomes a struggle.</p>
